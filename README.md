- Gender validation (Male/Female/Other)
- Age validation (1-119 years)
- Date validation (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Time validation (HH:MM format)

### Data Persistence
- File-based data storage using CSV format
- Automatic data directory creation
- Persistent storage across application sessions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Model Classes (Patient, Doctor, Appointment)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Access Objects (PatientDAO, DoctorDAO, AppointmentDAO)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service Layer (PatientService, DoctorService, AppointmentService)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Utility Classes (InputValidator)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Application (Console Interface)
```

### Key Components:

- **Model Classes**: Represent core entities with proper encapsulation
- **DAO Pattern**: Handles data persistence and retrieval operations
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and validation
- **Input Validation**: Ensures data integrity and consistency
- **Console Interface**: Provides user-friendly menu-driven interaction

## üíª Code Structure

### Model Classes
```java
// Patient entity with complete CRUD operations
static class Patient {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String gender;
    private String contact;
    // Getters, setters, and utility methods
}
```

### Service Layer Example
```java
public void addPatient(String name, int age, String gender, String contact) {
    // Input validation
    if (!InputValidator.isValidName(name)) {
        System.out.println("Invalid name.");
        return;
    }
    // Business logic and data persistence
    int id = dao.getNextId();
    Patient patient = new Patient(id, name, age, gender, contact);
    dao.addPatient(patient);
    System.out.println("Patient added successfully with ID: " + id);
}
```

### Data Validation
```java
static class InputValidator {
    public static boolean isValidName(String name) {
        return name != null && name.matches("[A-Za-z ]{2,50}");
    }
    
    public static boolean isValidContact(String contact) {
        return contact != null && contact.matches("[0-9]{10}");
    }
}
```

## ‚≠ê Key Innovative Features

### 1. **Smart Cross-Reference Integration**
One of the standout features of this application is the intelligent cross-referencing system between patients, doctors, and appointments. When displaying appointment lists, the system automatically fetches and displays patient names and doctor names instead of just showing IDs, providing a more user-friendly experience.

**Implementation Highlight:**
```java
public void listAppointments() {
    List<Appointment> appointments = dao.getAllAppointments();
    for (Appointment a : appointments) {
        Patient p = patientDAO.getPatientById(a.getPatientId());
        Doctor d = doctorDAO.getDoctorById(a.getDoctorId());
        System.out.println("ID: " + a.getId() + 
            ", Patient: " + (p != null ? p.getName() : "Unknown") +
            ", Doctor: " + (d != null ? d.getName() : "Unknown") +
            ", Date: " + a.getDate() + ", Time: " + a.getTime());
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced user experience with meaningful data display
- Maintains data integrity through proper referential checks
- Handles edge cases when referenced entities might not exist
- Demonstrates advanced object-oriented design principles

### 2. **Comprehensive Input Validation Framework**
The application features a robust, centralized validation system that ensures data integrity across all modules. The `InputValidator` class implements regex-based validation with specific business rules for healthcare data.

**Implementation Highlight:**
```java
static class InputValidator {
    // Name validation: Only alphabetic characters and spaces, 2-50 chars
    public static boolean isValidName(String name) {
        return name != null && name.matches("[A-Za-z ]{2,50}");
    }
    
    // Contact validation: Exactly 10 digits for phone numbers
    public static boolean isValidContact(String contact) {
        return contact != null && contact.matches("[0-9]{10}");
    }
    
    // Date validation: Strict YYYY-MM-DD format
    public static boolean isValidDate(String date) {
        return date != null && date.matches("\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}");
    }
}
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Regex Pattern Matching**: Ensures data format consistency
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Age limits (1-119), gender options, contact format
- **Centralized Validation**: Single source of truth for all validation rules
- **Graceful Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for invalid inputs
- **Preventive Data Corruption**: Stops invalid data from entering the system

**Real-world Application:**
This validation framework mimics enterprise-level applications where data integrity is crucial, especially in healthcare systems where incorrect data could have serious consequences.
